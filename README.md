# Azure Virtual Machine custom extension with Bicep
This article takes you step by step on how to install a custom Powershell extension on a Windows Azure Virtual Machine using Bicep. Am going to be using the Azure community [quickstart-templates](https://github.com/Azure/azure-quickstart-templates/tree/master). In general, I highly recommand looking into these templates before starting any Azure project from scratch

## 1. Create your Virtual Machine
Am going with the vm-simple

## 2. Create a Storage Account for your custom script
## 3. Install the extension 

## Next steps
You can create an Azure devops pipeline that would automate these tasks. You can split this into three jobs: deploy VM, copy files into storage and deploy extension
